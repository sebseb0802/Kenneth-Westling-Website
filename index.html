            Having spent my childhood in Asia (Philippines), my teenage years in Africa (Cote D’Ivoire) and Europe (England and Austria), and my university/work years in the United States (Boston, DC, and Los Angeles), I’ve had the privilege of being exposed to a wide range of backgrounds, ideas, and cultures my entire life.

            Ever since I was in my teens, I've always had an interest in the internet and it eventually led me to create my own website on sites like Geocities and Angelfire. The one thing I didn't know at the time was that this was preparing me all along for my first job out of University as an Internet Marketing Specialist at E-site Marketing where I was tasked to optimize the SEO efforts of our hospitality clients.

            As the social media space continued to grow, my interest in this emerging area grew with it. This passion eventually led me to Five Guys where I spent 5+ years leading their social media program. As a team, we were able to make Five Guys (arguably) the best burger joint out there. Over the past two years, I was working for Applebee’s helping to (re)build their online presence and brand. With a big focus on ROI, my attention was on ensuring that every activity drove revenue and delivered on Applebee’s corporate objectives.

            With over seven years of social media management experience, I know that I would be a great asset to any team! If any of this sounds like what you're looking for, let's talk!
